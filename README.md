# Test-Efficiency-of-Flajolet-Martin-FM-algorithm
The goal of this exercise is to test the efficacy of the Flajolet-Martin (FM) algorithm and its variants in estimating the number of distinct elements. We will first count distinct words and shingles in the text file http://norvig.com/big.txt and then test it on a larger stream of numbers generated according to the power law distribution.

See detailed description in the pdf file, problem 3.
